# Choir Music Search Project - Conversation Log

## Session Date: [Current Date]

### Conversation 1
**User Prompt**: "what was the last command you remember?"
**AI Response**: Explained that I don't have access to persistent memory between conversations, but offered to help with the choir music search project. Noted that the user had backend/config.env open.

### Conversation 2
**User Prompt**: "Can you create a document you update continously with what we have talked about and plan to do so you don't start afresh all the time? Can you also set up so you check it and remind me where we're at when you start up?"
**AI Response**: 
- Explained limitations: I cannot create persistent files that survive between conversations or automatically check them on startup
- Created PROJECT_STATUS.md as a comprehensive project documentation file
- Document includes: project overview, architecture, status tracking, configuration details, development commands, deployment status
- Provided instructions on how to use the document manually at the start of each session
- Offered to help update specific sections

### Conversation 3
**User Prompt**: "Create a text document where you write a summary of each prompt and response given here from now on. I know you can create text documents and read them."
**AI Response**: Created CONVERSATION_LOG.md for session continuity tracking.

### Conversation 4
**User Prompt**: "Set a job so you check this file each time the program starts and summarize what was agreed on during the last session."
**AI Response**: 
- Explained that I cannot set up automated startup jobs due to technical limitations
- Created startup-summary.sh (Linux/Mac) and startup-summary.bat (Windows) scripts
- These scripts provide quick project status summaries
- Provided workflow: run script → open files → tell AI to read them for context

### Conversation 5
**User Prompt**: "Can you set up something that calls you when cursor starts up and gives you initial instructions?"
**AI Response**:
- Explained technical limitations: cannot set up automated processes or background tasks
- Created Cursor workspace configuration (.vscode/tasks.json) with quick start tasks
- Updated package.json with convenient npm scripts (npm run status, npm run backend, etc.)
- Created CURSOR_STARTUP.md with clear instructions for getting AI assistant up to speed
- Provided manual workflow: run npm run status → open files → tell AI to read them

### Conversation 6
**User Prompt**: "Can you clean up the files in the project so files no longer in use or that are duplicates are removed?"
**AI Response**:
- Analyzed project structure and identified duplicates/unused files
- Removed duplicate server files (kept server-supabase.ts, removed server.ts)
- Removed duplicate database schemas (kept PostgreSQL, removed MySQL)
- Removed unused files: Suggestions_for_better_search.ts, env.example, bun.lockb, saved_chats/
- Removed redundant documentation (INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Removed 30+ unused UI components (kept only: button, input, label, select, collapsible, toast, toaster, toggle, toggle-group, tooltip)
- Updated main README.md to be comprehensive and consolidated
- **Additional cleanup**: Removed 4 MySQL setup files (setup-database.js, setup-onecom.js, setup-railway.js, test-connection.js) since project uses Supabase PostgreSQL
- Updated backend documentation and startup scripts to reference only Supabase setup
- Project is now cleaner and more focused

### Conversation 7
**User Prompt**: "Please check so vite uses the right files again"
**AI Response**: 
- Verified Vite configuration and file structure
- Confirmed Vite is correctly pointing to src/main.tsx → src/App.tsx
- App.tsx is self-contained with no external component imports
- Vite dev server running on port 5174 (port 5173 was in use)
- All dependencies properly installed
- File structure is clean with unused components moved to _backup folders

### Conversation 8
**User Prompt**: "still 404" (referring to Supabase Edge Function)
**AI Response**: 
- Identified that Edge Function is returning 404 errors despite successful deployment
- Confirmed Supabase project is accessible (REST API returns 200)
- Issue is specifically with Edge Function URL format
- Tried multiple URL patterns: /functions/v1/choir-music-api, /functions/choir-music-api
- Redeployed Edge Function with debug flag - deployment succeeded
- Still getting 404 after deployment propagation
- Edge Function uses mock data only (no database connection issues)

### Conversation 9
**User Prompt**: "Please note, the database access link you've got is not for direct connection, but instead a transaction pooler. Does that matter?"
**AI Response**: 
- Clarified that current Edge Function uses mock data only, so transaction pooler URL doesn't affect it
- The 404 issue is with Edge Function URL format, not database connection
- Edge Function contains hardcoded mock results for testing

### Conversation 10
**User Prompt**: "update conversation_log.md with a summary of the current conversation and where we currently are in troubleshooting."
**AI Response**: [This update]

### Conversation 11
**User Prompt**: "This is the code supplied by supabase to invoke the function. Can it give any clues to why we get 404s?"
**AI Response**: 
- Analyzed Supabase's curl command format
- **Key Discovery**: Supabase uses POST requests, not GET
- **URL Format**: Base function URL without /health or /search endpoints
- **Headers**: Only Authorization and Content-Type (no apikey needed)
- **Data**: Includes JSON payload
- **Root Cause Identified**: Our Edge Function only handled GET requests
- **Fix Applied**: Added POST handler for root path (`/`)
- **Docker Issue**: API version conflict preventing deployment

### Conversation 12
**User Prompt**: "fix docker"
**AI Response**: 
- **Attempted**: Restart Docker Desktop processes
- **Attempted**: Switch Docker contexts (default vs desktop-linux)
- **Attempted**: Check Docker daemon status
- **Result**: Docker API version mismatch persisted
- **Solution**: User decided to restart computer

### Conversation 13
**User Prompt**: "I'm going to restart the computer to see if it fixes the issue"
**AI Response**: Confirmed restart was the right approach for Docker API conflicts

### Conversation 14
**User Prompt**: "check docker now"
**AI Response**: 
- **Result**: Docker working perfectly after restart
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed Edge Function (version 7)
- **Testing**: Still getting 404 errors on both POST and GET requests
- **Status**: Function shows as ACTIVE but not accessible

### Conversation 15
**User Prompt**: "We've already tried that. Can you keep a log of what you've already tried to solve an issue?"
**AI Response**: [This update]

### Conversation 16
**User Prompt**: "This is what supabase says about how to invoke the function (again):" [Provided curl command]
**AI Response**: 
- **Breakthrough**: Used JavaScript fetch instead of PowerShell
- **Key Discovery**: Function returned `{"error":"Not found"}` with debug info
- **Root Cause Found**: Function receives path `/choir-music-api` not `/`
- **Fix Applied**: Updated path matching to handle both `/` and `/choir-music-api`
- **Result**: Both POST and GET endpoints now working perfectly!

### Conversation 17
**User Prompt**: "try connecting to it now please"
**AI Response**: 
- **SUCCESS**: POST endpoint working - returns `{"message":"Edge Function is working!","method":"POST","timestamp":"2025-09-17T14:27:31.772Z"}`
- **SUCCESS**: Search endpoint working - returns proper search results for "Bach" query
- **Frontend Update**: Updated App.tsx to use correct API format (GET with Authorization header only)

### Conversation 19
**User Prompt**: "how do I set up a flow to deploy to one.com at will?"
**AI Response**: 
- **Created comprehensive one.com deployment setup**
- **Files Created**:
  - `ONE.COM-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
  - `scripts/deploy-onecom.js` - Automated deployment script
  - `onecom.config.example.js` - FTP configuration template
  - `.github/workflows/deploy-onecom.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
  - `env.production.example` - Production environment template
  - `setup-onecom-deploy.sh/.bat` - Setup scripts
- **Package.json Updated**: Added deployment scripts (`deploy:onecom`, `deploy:preview`, `deploy:dry-run`)
- **Dependencies Added**: `ftp-deploy` for automated FTP deployment
- **Deployment Methods**: Manual, automated, and GitHub Actions

## Current Status (Latest Session)
**Date**: September 17, 2025
**Issue**: Supabase Edge Function returning 404 errors
**Frontend**: Working correctly on http://localhost:5174
**Backend**: Edge Function deployed successfully but not accessible via expected URLs

### Technical Details
- **Frontend**: React app with simplified App.tsx (self-contained, no external imports)
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Function with mock data (no database dependency)
- **Vite**: Running on port 5174, correctly configured
- **Edge Function**: Deployed to project kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu, shows as ACTIVE
- **URLs Tested**: 
  - https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/v1/choir-music-api/health (404)
  - https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/choir-music-api/health (404)
- **CORS**: Fixed with proper headers in Edge Function
- **Authentication**: Using correct apikey and Authorization headers

### Current Problem
Edge Function deployment succeeds but function is not accessible via any tested URL format. Need to determine correct URL pattern for Supabase Edge Functions.

### Troubleshooting Attempts Log
**Edge Function 404 Issue - What We've Tried:**

✅ **URL Formats Tested:**
- `https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/v1/choir-music-api/health` (GET) - 404
- `https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/v1/choir-music-api/search` (GET) - 404  
- `https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/v1/choir-music-api` (POST) - 404
- `https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/choir-music-api` (POST) - 404

✅ **Headers Tested:**
- `Authorization: Bearer [token]` only
- `Authorization: Bearer [token]` + `Content-Type: application/json`
- `apikey: [token]` + `Authorization: Bearer [token]`
- `apikey: [token]` only

✅ **Methods Tested:**
- GET requests to /health and /search endpoints
- POST requests to root path
- OPTIONS requests (CORS preflight)

✅ **Deployment Status:**
- Function deployed successfully (version 7)
- Shows as ACTIVE in Supabase dashboard
- Docker working properly after restart

✅ **Code Changes Made:**
- Added POST handler for root path (`/`)
- Fixed CORS headers
- Added proper error handling

❌ **Still Not Working:**
- All URL formats return 404
- Function appears deployed but not accessible
- No error logs available from Supabase CLI

### Next Steps
1. **Check Supabase Dashboard** for function logs/errors
2. **Try different authentication approach** (service role key)
3. **Verify function deployment** in Supabase dashboard
4. **Test with Supabase's exact curl command** format
5. **Consider function code syntax issues** (though code looks correct)
