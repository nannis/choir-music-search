# Choir Music Search Project - Conversation Log

## Session Date: [Current Date]

### Conversation 1
**User Prompt**: "what was the last command you remember?"
**AI Response**: Explained that I don't have access to persistent memory between conversations, but offered to help with the choir music search project. Noted that the user had backend/config.env open.

### Conversation 2
**User Prompt**: "Can you create a document you update continously with what we have talked about and plan to do so you don't start afresh all the time? Can you also set up so you check it and remind me where we're at when you start up?"
**AI Response**: 
- Explained limitations: I cannot create persistent files that survive between conversations or automatically check them on startup
- Created PROJECT_STATUS.md as a comprehensive project documentation file
- Document includes: project overview, architecture, status tracking, configuration details, development commands, deployment status
- Provided instructions on how to use the document manually at the start of each session
- Offered to help update specific sections

### Conversation 3
**User Prompt**: "Create a text document where you write a summary of each prompt and response given here from now on. I know you can create text documents and read them."
**AI Response**: Created CONVERSATION_LOG.md for session continuity tracking.

### Conversation 4
**User Prompt**: "Set a job so you check this file each time the program starts and summarize what was agreed on during the last session."
**AI Response**: 
- Explained that I cannot set up automated startup jobs due to technical limitations
- Created startup-summary.sh (Linux/Mac) and startup-summary.bat (Windows) scripts
- These scripts provide quick project status summaries
- Provided workflow: run script → open files → tell AI to read them for context

### Conversation 5
**User Prompt**: "Can you set up something that calls you when cursor starts up and gives you initial instructions?"
**AI Response**:
- Explained technical limitations: cannot set up automated processes or background tasks
- Created Cursor workspace configuration (.vscode/tasks.json) with quick start tasks
- Updated package.json with convenient npm scripts (npm run status, npm run backend, etc.)
- Created CURSOR_STARTUP.md with clear instructions for getting AI assistant up to speed
- Provided manual workflow: run npm run status → open files → tell AI to read them

### Conversation 6
**User Prompt**: "Can you clean up the files in the project so files no longer in use or that are duplicates are removed?"
**AI Response**:
- Analyzed project structure and identified duplicates/unused files
- Removed duplicate server files (kept server-supabase.ts, removed server.ts)
- Removed duplicate database schemas (kept PostgreSQL, removed MySQL)
- Removed unused files: Suggestions_for_better_search.ts, env.example, bun.lockb, saved_chats/
- Removed redundant documentation (INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- Removed 30+ unused UI components (kept only: button, input, label, select, collapsible, toast, toaster, toggle, toggle-group, tooltip)
- Updated main README.md to be comprehensive and consolidated
- **Additional cleanup**: Removed 4 MySQL setup files (setup-database.js, setup-onecom.js, setup-railway.js, test-connection.js) since project uses Supabase PostgreSQL
- Updated backend documentation and startup scripts to reference only Supabase setup

### Conversation 7
**User Prompt**: "what was the last thing we did before closing the app?"
**AI Response**: 
- Checked git status and found uncommitted changes
- Identified that mandatory pre-push tests weren't running due to missing git hooks
- Discovered accessibility violations in axe-core audit
- Started fixing accessibility issues by adding landmark elements

**User Prompt**: "try again, but check the local commits first."
**AI Response**: Checked git log and found recent commits, then proceeded with git status check.

**User Prompt**: "can we commit and push now then?"
**AI Response**: Attempted to commit and push, but discovered pre-push hook was failing due to low test coverage.

**User Prompt**: "I get the feeling the mandatory tests that should be run before each push weren't run. Is that true, and if so, why?"
**AI Response**: Confirmed that pre-push tests weren't running. The issue was that git hooks weren't properly set up for Windows PowerShell environment.

**User Prompt**: "yes"
**AI Response**: Started setting up proper git hooks for Windows using PowerShell scripts.

**User Prompt**: "try again"
**AI Response**: Continued working on git hooks setup, converting shell scripts to PowerShell for Windows compatibility.

**User Prompt**: "I think that backend code shoud also be covered, but not scripts. Can you fix this?"
**AI Response**: Updated pre-push hook to include backend code in coverage calculation while excluding scripts and Supabase functions.

**User Prompt**: "fix the test coverage of the backend code please. Ask for requirements if someting is unclear."
**AI Response**: Started creating comprehensive backend tests including unit tests (mocked) and integration tests (real database).

**User Prompt**: "I think you should both do unit tests (mocked) and integration tests of the backend and database. It needs to work with both. It is also important that the api stays stable unless changes are made both to the front end and backend simultaniously (at which point tests in both ends needs to be updated)."
**AI Response**: Created comprehensive backend testing strategy with unit tests, integration tests, and API contract tests to ensure frontend-backend compatibility.

**User Prompt**: "And the accessibility tests?"
**AI Response**: Integrated accessibility tests into the testing strategy and git hooks.

**User Prompt**: "The accessibility test doesn't seem to exit properly"
**AI Response**: Fixed accessibility test script issues including timeouts, browser cleanup, and JSON parsing.

**User Prompt**: "try again" (multiple times)
**AI Response**: Continued fixing accessibility test script stability issues.

**User Prompt**: "Now then?"
**AI Response**: Fixed accessibility violations by adding `<main>` and `<header>` landmark elements to App.tsx.

**User Prompt**: "fix thre issues and then commit and push"
**AI Response**: Fixed accessibility violations and attempted to commit, but tests were failing due to comprehensive backend tests with mocking issues.

**User Prompt**: "But the tests failed?"
**AI Response**: Explained that the comprehensive backend tests I created were failing due to mocking problems, while accessibility tests were passing.

**User Prompt**: "No, fix the issues and make the tests work."
**AI Response**: Installed missing testing dependencies and fixed test configuration to use Supabase credentials properly.

**User Prompt**: "But the postgres database is in supabase. The credentials is in the env file."
**AI Response**: Fixed test configuration to use Supabase database credentials from environment variables instead of local PostgreSQL.

**User Prompt**: "It's fine that it uses the credentials in the env file, but make sure they are not included in any file that is tracked in git."
**AI Response**: Verified .gitignore properly excludes .env files and ensured credentials are not hardcoded in tracked files.

**User Prompt**: "Yes please. Do two separate commits and pushes: one with the successful accessability tests and one after you fix the failing backend tests. Do not include the backend tests in the first commit if you can avoid it. I only want working code in main!"
**AI Response**: 
- Moved failing comprehensive backend tests to temp directory
- Successfully committed accessibility fixes (main/header landmarks, improved test scripts)
- Attempted to push but failed due to coverage issues (backend files dragging down coverage)
- Excluded backend files from vitest coverage until comprehensive tests are fixed
- Updated .gitignore to exclude backend/node_modules
- Push still failing due to large files in backend/node_modules being detected by pre-push hook

**User Prompt**: "The test coverage is checking the entire code including backend. Can you exclude the backend coverage duntil we fixed the backend tests?"
**AI Response**: Excluded backend files from vitest coverage configuration and updated pre-push hook accordingly.

**User Prompt**: "It didn't get stuck on the coverage. It got stuck on checiking for large files."
**AI Response**: Identified that pre-push hook is detecting large files in backend/node_modules directory even though it's in .gitignore.

**User Prompt**: "try again"
**AI Response**: Added backend/node_modules to .gitignore and committed changes, but push still failing due to large files detection.

**User Prompt**: "Need to call it a day. Before that: 1) Summarize what we need to do tomorrow to finish the current commit and push. 2) Summarize what we need to do to get test coverage on the backend files and and add them back to be commited. 3) Save this conversation in CONVERSATION_LOG.md"
**AI Response**: 
1. **To finish current commit/push**: Remove backend/node_modules directory or modify pre-push hook to only check committed files
2. **To get backend test coverage**: Fix comprehensive backend tests (mocking issues), re-enable backend coverage in vitest.config.ts, ensure all tests pass
3. **Saving this conversation**: Added detailed summary to CONVERSATION_LOG.md

**Key Accomplishments**:
- ✅ Fixed accessibility violations (main/header landmarks)
- ✅ Improved accessibility test scripts
- ✅ Set up comprehensive backend testing strategy
- ✅ Installed missing testing dependencies
- ✅ Fixed test configuration for Supabase
- ✅ Excluded backend from coverage until tests are fixed
- ✅ Updated .gitignore for node_modules

**Remaining Issues**:
- ❌ Push blocked by large files in backend/node_modules
- ❌ Comprehensive backend tests need mocking fixes
- ❌ Backend coverage disabled until tests are working

**Next Steps**:
1. Remove backend/node_modules or fix pre-push hook
2. Fix backend test mocking issues
3. Re-enable backend coverage
4. Complete second commit with working backend tests
- Project is now cleaner and more focused

### Conversation 7
**User Prompt**: "Please check so vite uses the right files again"
**AI Response**: 
- Verified Vite configuration and file structure
- Confirmed Vite is correctly pointing to src/main.tsx → src/App.tsx
- App.tsx is self-contained with no external component imports
- Vite dev server running on port 5174 (port 5173 was in use)
- All dependencies properly installed
- File structure is clean with unused components moved to _backup folders

### Conversation 8
**User Prompt**: "still 404" (referring to Supabase Edge Function)
**AI Response**: 
- Identified that Edge Function is returning 404 errors despite successful deployment
- Confirmed Supabase project is accessible (REST API returns 200)
- Issue is specifically with Edge Function URL format
- Tried multiple URL patterns: /functions/v1/choir-music-api, /functions/choir-music-api
- Redeployed Edge Function with debug flag - deployment succeeded
- Still getting 404 after deployment propagation
- Edge Function uses mock data only (no database connection issues)

### Conversation 9
**User Prompt**: "Please note, the database access link you've got is not for direct connection, but instead a transaction pooler. Does that matter?"
**AI Response**: 
- Clarified that current Edge Function uses mock data only, so transaction pooler URL doesn't affect it
- The 404 issue is with Edge Function URL format, not database connection
- Edge Function contains hardcoded mock results for testing

### Conversation 10
**User Prompt**: "update conversation_log.md with a summary of the current conversation and where we currently are in troubleshooting."
**AI Response**: [This update]

### Conversation 11
**User Prompt**: "This is the code supplied by supabase to invoke the function. Can it give any clues to why we get 404s?"
**AI Response**: 
- Analyzed Supabase's curl command format
- **Key Discovery**: Supabase uses POST requests, not GET
- **URL Format**: Base function URL without /health or /search endpoints
- **Headers**: Only Authorization and Content-Type (no apikey needed)
- **Data**: Includes JSON payload
- **Root Cause Identified**: Our Edge Function only handled GET requests
- **Fix Applied**: Added POST handler for root path (`/`)
- **Docker Issue**: API version conflict preventing deployment

### Conversation 12
**User Prompt**: "fix docker"
**AI Response**: 
- **Attempted**: Restart Docker Desktop processes
- **Attempted**: Switch Docker contexts (default vs desktop-linux)
- **Attempted**: Check Docker daemon status
- **Result**: Docker API version mismatch persisted
- **Solution**: User decided to restart computer

### Conversation 13
**User Prompt**: "I'm going to restart the computer to see if it fixes the issue"
**AI Response**: Confirmed restart was the right approach for Docker API conflicts

### Conversation 14
**User Prompt**: "check docker now"
**AI Response**: 
- **Result**: Docker working perfectly after restart
- **Deployment**: Successfully deployed Edge Function (version 7)
- **Testing**: Still getting 404 errors on both POST and GET requests
- **Status**: Function shows as ACTIVE but not accessible

### Conversation 15
**User Prompt**: "We've already tried that. Can you keep a log of what you've already tried to solve an issue?"
**AI Response**: [This update]

### Conversation 16
**User Prompt**: "This is what supabase says about how to invoke the function (again):" [Provided curl command]
**AI Response**: 
- **Breakthrough**: Used JavaScript fetch instead of PowerShell
- **Key Discovery**: Function returned `{"error":"Not found"}` with debug info
- **Root Cause Found**: Function receives path `/choir-music-api` not `/`
- **Fix Applied**: Updated path matching to handle both `/` and `/choir-music-api`
- **Result**: Both POST and GET endpoints now working perfectly!

### Conversation 17
**User Prompt**: "try connecting to it now please"
**AI Response**: 
- **SUCCESS**: POST endpoint working - returns `{"message":"Edge Function is working!","method":"POST","timestamp":"2025-09-17T14:27:31.772Z"}`
- **SUCCESS**: Search endpoint working - returns proper search results for "Bach" query
- **Frontend Update**: Updated App.tsx to use correct API format (GET with Authorization header only)

### Conversation 19
**User Prompt**: "how do I set up a flow to deploy to one.com at will?"
**AI Response**: 
- **Created comprehensive one.com deployment setup**
- **Files Created**:
  - `ONE.COM-DEPLOYMENT.md` - Complete deployment guide
  - `scripts/deploy-onecom.js` - Automated deployment script

## Current Status (Latest Session)
**Date**: September 17, 2025
**Issue**: Supabase Edge Function returning 404 errors
**Frontend**: Working correctly on http://localhost:5174
**Backend**: Edge Function deployed successfully but not accessible via expected URLs

### Technical Details
- **Frontend**: React app with simplified App.tsx (self-contained, no external imports)
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Function with mock data (no database dependency)
- **Vite**: Running on port 5174, correctly configured
- **Edge Function**: Deployed to project kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu, shows as ACTIVE
- **URLs Tested**: 
  - https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/v1/choir-music-api/health (404)
  - https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/choir-music-api/health (404)
- **CORS**: Fixed with proper headers in Edge Function
- **Authentication**: Using correct apikey and Authorization headers

### Current Problem
Edge Function deployment succeeds but function is not accessible via any tested URL format. Need to determine correct URL pattern for Supabase Edge Functions.

### Troubleshooting Attempts Log
**Edge Function 404 Issue - What We've Tried:**

✅ **URL Formats Tested:**
- `https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/v1/choir-music-api/health` (GET) - 404
- `https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/v1/choir-music-api/search` (GET) - 404  
- `https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/v1/choir-music-api` (POST) - 404
- `https://kqjccswtdxkffghuijhu.supabase.co/functions/choir-music-api` (POST) - 404

✅ **Headers Tested:**
- `Authorization: Bearer [token]` only
- `Authorization: Bearer [token]` + `Content-Type: application/json`
- `apikey: [token]` + `Authorization: Bearer [token]`
- `apikey: [token]` only

✅ **Methods Tested:**
- GET requests to /health and /search endpoints
- POST requests to root path
- OPTIONS requests (CORS preflight)

✅ **Deployment Status:**
- Function deployed successfully (version 7)
- Shows as ACTIVE in Supabase dashboard
- Docker working properly after restart

✅ **Code Changes Made:**
- Added POST handler for root path (`/`)
- Fixed CORS headers
- Added proper error handling

❌ **Still Not Working:**
- All URL formats return 404
- Function appears deployed but not accessible
- No error logs available from Supabase CLI

### Next Steps
1. **Check Supabase Dashboard** for function logs/errors
2. **Try different authentication approach** (service role key)
3. **Verify function deployment** in Supabase dashboard
4. **Test with Supabase's exact curl command** format
5. **Consider function code syntax issues** (though code looks correct)

## Latest Session: Test Setup and JWT Authentication Issues
**Date:** January 2024
**Topic:** Integration Testing with Supabase JWT Authentication

### Current Challenge
The user wants proper integration tests that work with Supabase Row Level Security. Main issue:
- Tests need JWT tokens with `role: "test_service"` to bypass RLS
- Supabase's `mint-test-jwt` Edge Function is returning 401 Unauthorized
- Despite following documentation, unable to authenticate with the function

### Current Status
**Files created:** 
- ✅ Updated Edge Function with safe insertion functions
- ✅ RLS policies for test access (`test-rls-policies.sql`)
- ✅ Duplicate prevention system (`remove-duplicates-and-prevent-future.sql`)
- ✅ Main integration tests (`female-choir-sources.test.ts`) 
- ✅ Simplified test approach (`simple-female-choir.test.ts`)

**Deployment status:**
- ✅ Edge Function `choir-music-api` deployed successfully
- ✅ Edge Function `mint-test-jwt` downloaded but auth issues
- ❌ Integration tests failing due to JWT minting issues

### Next Action
**User restarting computer.** Prepared message for Supabase AI to troubleshoot mint-test-jwt function authentication.
